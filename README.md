The Caffeinated Repository package allows the means to implement a standard boilerplate repository interface. This covers the standard Eloquent methods in a non-static, non-facade driven way right out of the box. Fear not though Batman! The Caffeinated Repository package does not limit you in any way when it comes to customizing (e.g overriding) the provided interface or adding your own methods.

The package follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code.

Quick Installation
------------------
Begin by installing the package through Composer.

```
composer require caffeinated/repository=~2.0

And that's it! With your coffee in reach, start building out some awesome web applications!
